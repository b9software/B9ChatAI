* Want to Help?

  Thank you for your interest in providing help. Currently, I welcome the following types of help:

  1. Improving and expanding existing documents.
  2. Enhancing existing translations or translating the application into other languages.
  3. I would like to add support for more engines, such as Claude and Azure OpenAI. If you can provide a testing API Key, that would be very helpful. Contact me via Twitter direct message [@BB9z](https://twitter.com/BB9z).

## Long Term Planning

* Open Source

  This project will be open source definitely, but not at the moment. I will choose the appropriate time to make it open source. The deadline for this is January 1, 2024.

* Price

  The application is a one-time purchase and will never adopt a subscription model.

  This app will be free for a limited time. Whenever there is a major update to the app, the price tier may be raised by one level. I will lower the price tier for one week before increasing it.

## Beta Test Channel

If you join, your Apple ID email will be shared with me. I cannot guarantee that this beta version will always be newer than the AppStore version.
