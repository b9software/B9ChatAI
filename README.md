> **This app will not available on the Mac App Store**
>
> I developed this application solely to meet my own needs, but if I need to launch it on the App Store, I must add a sales API usage function, which goes against my original intention of creating a clean client.

## Features

- Free, open-source, pure (compressed size 1.6MB), and performs well (lower memory usage compared to similar apps, needs optimizing large content of text).
- Context is not attached by default (to save API usage). You can attach it manually by selecting and confirming (the default shortcut key is Command+K). and the context will keep sending after that. No more selecting the number of contexts like in other apps.
- Use system prompts in different conversations. No more repeated pasting and editing.
- Support for continuing a chat from any historical message.
- One-click continuation (historical content modification, re-generation in plan).
- Support pure keyboard control, common functions have shortcut keys.
- Support for calling AI functions from any application via [ShortCuts](https://github.com/b9software/B9ChatAI/wiki/Combine-with-Shortcuts).
- No menu bar mode, floating window mode is a better interaction way.
- Free window size, support multiple windows, multiple tabs; multiple engines.
- Support inter-app communication, e.g., I use Raycast to switch between common sessions.

Overall, it's a decent desktop client where efficiency is a priority.
