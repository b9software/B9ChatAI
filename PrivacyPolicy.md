# Privacy Policy

BB9z built the B9ChatAI app as a paid app. This SERVICE is provided by BB9z at no cost and is intended for use as is. If you choose to use my Service, then means you agree to this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

B9ChatAI does not collect any of your data, and all data is under your control.

However, when using the application, third-party services may be called upon, which may collect your information.
While you have control over which services are called upon, it is still important for you to be vigilant about protecting your information, carefully read and understand the privacy policies of related services, and be especially cautious when using proxy servers provided by third parties.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I will adhere to the guidelines of not collecting any information and protecting your privacy.

Therefore, this policy should not require any further updates.

However, if I have to change it in the future, I will inform you by publishing the updated Privacy Policy on this page.

Although there is no guarantee, you may also receive notifications about updates within the app.
